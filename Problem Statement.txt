Scenario 1:

	This was related to book library. Provide operations to add/remove/update/delete entities like a member, a book.
	The system should be able to lend a book to registered members. One of the constraint given was a member can atmost 
	be given 6 books only at a time.

	SAVINGS account can be opened by an individual. CURRENT account can be opened by corporate only.
	The operations that should be provided by system are
		Add/remove/update/delete an account.
		Calculate interest for a given account.
		in future, new type of account like Loan account, recurring account should be added.

	Also interviewer asked about how to fit ORM layer in this system.
	
	He also asked why do we add a service layer when one can define those operations in bean itself!
